## Contract for whole program

We want to take environmental variables and estimate the net profit of a field of crops of a specific size.


## Contracts for each module

### Module 1
Take environmental variables (land area, sunlight, seed density, water, fertilizer) and estimate the total crop yield for that field.

### Module 2
Take output from Module 1, and factor in the market price of that specific crop to estimate the gross profit from that field of crops.

### Module 3
Take output from Module 2, and factor in the costs of production to produce the estimated total net profit.
